{"name":"1234765","tagline":"Mission Statement","body":"1234765\r\n=======Hello\r\nWelcome to OrganicLivingNow. My better half and I have recently retired. Due to health issues, we have made a conscious choice to eat organically. There is far too much \"Frankenfood\" chemically laden, GMO infected, and un-natural foods parading as \"Healthy\" alternatives. As far as I can tell the only \"Healthy Alternative\" would be food that hasn't been genetically altered, chemically treated, and bathed in preservatives, and pesticides. That leaves one obvious choice REAL ORGANIC food.\r\n\r\nSince we started eating real food, we have seen marked improvements in our health. I am no longer insulin dependent, and am off ALL diabetes medication. I have lost a significant amount of weight, and feel generally better. My energy level is better than it has been in years. My better half eats the foods I eat, and has lost weight, has more energy, and less aches and pains. So I guess the old saying, \" You are what you eat\" has some truth.\r\n\r\nYou would think that living in a part of California where we are virtually surrounded by farms, finding \"Organic\" fruits and vegetables would be easy. Not so. Our food sources are being destroyed by corporate greed, and the thirst for profits at any cost. \"What cost\" you might ask. The cost of polluting the very ground water we so desperately need with chemical fertilizers, toxic insect spray, and the need for profits at any cost. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to educate, be educated, and hopefully build a community of like minded people. If enough people pressure the Costcos, Walmarts, Safeways, etc. Of the world it is in their best interest to NOT kill their consumers with deceptive advertising using such words as \"Natural, healthy, farm fresh, etc.\"  There is NO substitute for organic food. You know the old saying, \" If you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig\" applies here.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
